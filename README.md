# Better Split

An easier way to split bills and track personal expenses using Splitwise.

This application makes use of 2 APIs:
- VeryFi API, which extracts expense information from images of receipts.
- Splitwise API, to interact with Splitwise to create expenses.

Note:
This project has been developed, nearly 90% of it, with the help of AI (Perplexity) so far and it is an experiment to understand the limits of AI-generated code, so expect a lot of messy, bug-filled code.
